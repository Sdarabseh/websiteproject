<p style="color: white;">The first thing is the qulaifiers the way it works is all the countries around the world are put into groups based of where they are in the world so only european countries would only play european countries and soith american countries would only play south american 4 make it to the group stages in the better continaints like europe but cotinanints that arn't that good at football as other like North america only 2 or so go into the group stages. Then the teams that get 1 under wqualfying all go into there on group that only 1 or 2 teams can qulify for the world cup</p></div>
<div class="Leo">
<p style="color: white;"> The second wave is the group stage were all 64 teams compete in 4 teams in 8 group stages that are based of letters. The first 2 teams of every group directly go to the next round its as simple as that. After that it is very simple its the exact same thing as most sports were you have 8 teams and 4 and 2 which becomes a 1 vs 1 </p></div></body></div></div></div>
