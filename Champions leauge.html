<p> The UEFA Champions League is one of the most prestigious tournaments in all of sports. Here's everything you need to know about the pre-eminent club soccer tournament in the world, which has been played annually since 1955. The UEFA Champions League is a soccer tournament of 32 teams that compete in five rounds for the right to be crowned the best club in European soccer. According to <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2819840-uefa-champions-league-explained-how-the-tournament-works">BR Football</a>

<p> The number of teams each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These scores are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.Since the 2009-10 season, the UEFA Champions League offers two qualification "streams" for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being a domestic league champion, and those qualified by virtue of being second through fourth in their domestic league. Five teams from each qualifying stream earn a place in the group stage.</p>
<div class="Walker">
<p>The other 22 teams qualified automatically, either as the defending UCL champion, the defending UEL champion or through their respective domestic leagues. Each of the top 12 ranked associations in the UEFA coefficients are guaranteed at least one spot, with more spots being allocated the higher a league's coefficient is. <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2819840-uefa-champions-league-explained-how-the-tournament-works">BR Football</a></p>
